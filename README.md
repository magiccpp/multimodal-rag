You need to prepare the markdown and content list with MinerU before you start
1. use pre-processing.py to replace the image reference like 'Fig. 1.2' with the image unique name in the markdown document.
2. use create-vector-db.py to prepare the vector database
3. use multi-modal.ipynb to make multi-modal chat.
